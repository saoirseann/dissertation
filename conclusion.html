        <p>In conclusion, the growing rise in technology is having a direct correlation with the decline in our reading habits. My essay explored the adverse effects of technology addiction, the hindrances of this obsession on the mind and the statistics representing the negative behaviours associated with it.</p>

        <p>Our addiction to technology has massively
           impacted our attention spans and how we retain information. We are so
           easily distracted that no longer is it a simple task to sit and read a
            book. Our brains have adapted to this new digital age with constant short
            bursts of information instantly available. We are more inclined to multitask
             now than before, despite this not being an effective way to work. </p>
             <blockquote>Andrew Sullivan sums it up perfectly, <strong>Multitasking was a mirage.</strong> </blockquote>
            <p> It's an unrealistic hope which everyone does by habit now, but nothing worthful can get
              achieved when doing it.</p>

              <p>Susan Greenfield reinforces the addictiveness of technology with her explanation
                that technology and screens are the new normal in this current digital age. As
                 <strong>screens are becoming ubiquitous. They are becoming addictive. They are becoming prescribed.</strong>
                  The most troubling issue though is that the less people engage in deep thinking,
                  the less empathetic they are likely to become. </p>
                  <blockquote>It is definite that we are addicted to
                  technology and more specifically smartphones as everyone in the UK checks <strong>them every 12 minutes</strong>.</blockquote>
                  <p> Truly alarming. Social media apps and websites can be considered <Strong>a kind of junk food for the brain: harmless enough in moderation, but deleterious
                        when over-indulged.</strong>
                          The use of technology needs to be monitored reasonably so that more time can be
                          spent indulging in reading and improving the ability to read deeply and empathise
                          with others.</p>
                          <p> Author Golden Krishna supports this as he states,
                           <Strong>these services have become more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes.</strong>
                           Mostly they are making us feel worse about ourselves, yet we continue to use them.
                           Why do you think that is?</p>
