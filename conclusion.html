     <p>To conclude, this essay examined how the rise of technology and its dependence is causing a clear and evidential decline in reading habits. It explored the effects of technology addiction, the hindrances of this obsession on the mind and the statistics representing the negative behaviours associated with it. Author Golden Krishna sums it up well and his belief that "these services have become more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes."  Mostly they make us feel worse about ourselves even when we use them.</p>

    <p>The evidence in my essay suggests that multitasking is not an effective way to work, and it shouldn't get carried out so frequently. Andrew Sullivan sums it up perfectly, "Multitasking was a mirage."   It's an unrealistic hope which everyone does by habit now, but nothing worthful can get achieved when doing it.  </p>

     <p>Susan Greenfield reinforces the addictiveness of technology with her explanation that technology and screens are the new normal in this current digital age. As "screens are becoming ubiquitous. They are becoming addictive. They are becoming prescribed."  The most troubling issue indicated from the research above is that the less people engage in deep thinking, the less empathetic they are likely to become. It is definite that we are addicted to technology and more specifically smartphones as everyone in the UK checks "them every 12 minutes".  Truly alarming. Social media apps and websites can be considered "a kind of junk food for the brain: harmless enough in moderation, but deleterious when over-indulged."   The use of technology needs to be monitored reasonably so that more time can be spent indulging in reading and improving the ability to read deeply and empathise with others.</p>
